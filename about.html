    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <p> Some of my hobbies include sports like soccer,tennis,basketball, sailing, golf, rock climbing and many other things.</p>
    <h3>Me as a computer science student</h3>
    <p>Before I had this class I had already made a few coding projects but I had only used blocks for coding like tinker and scratch. I chose to enroll in this class because I wanted to learn how to code at a higher level and because this could be a future job opportunity. I am exited to learn all the codes too make the screen change and how to use the codes.</p>
