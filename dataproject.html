    <h1>Which type of gum lasts longest?</h1>
    <h4>The question</h4>
    <p>If your the person who wants gum with long lasting flavor, then this is the perfect page for you! I did an experiment to help me make a recomendation on which gum to chose for longer lasting flavor.
      I experimented with three types of gum, Trident orange flavor, Orbit peppermint and Orbit spearmint. I tested each gum three times with one person over the span of three days to see how long the flavor lasts. Then I got the average of all three gums and made a graph. I hope my recomendation will help you choose which type of gum you want to buy.</p>
    <h4>What data I collected</h4>
    <p>How long each gum lasts? Which type of gum lasts longest? Which type of gum lasts shortest</p>
    <h4>Cleaning my data</h4>
      <p>Some of the problems I had while collecting data were.</p>
      <p>Human error, the person collecting data might not have said exactly when the flavor ran out and I might not have hit the stop button on the timer at the correct time. Each peice of gum is different in size and weight. Some gums might of had more flavor packed into them.</p>
    <h4>My recomendation</h4>
