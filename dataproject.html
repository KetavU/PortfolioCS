    <h2>Which type of gum lasts longest?</h2>
    <h4>The question</h4>
    <p>If your the person who wants gum with long lasting flavor, then this is the perfect page for you! I did an experiment to help me make a recomendation on which gum to chose for longer lasting flavor.
      I experimented with three types of gum, Trident orange flavor, Orbit peppermint and Orbit spearmint. I tested each gum three times with one person over the span of three days to see how long the flavor lasts. Then I got the average of all three gums and made a graph. I hope my recomendation will help you choose which type of gum you want to buy.</p>
   <h4>What data I collected</h4>
    <ul>
      How long each gum lasts
      Which type of gum lasts longest
      Which type of gum lasts shortest
      <ul/>
